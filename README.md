This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

first, next and react and react-dom getting.

```
(sudo) yarn add next react react-dom
```

next, run the development server:

```bash
(sudo) yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Precautions when Using Chakura UI. 

- Setting @chakra-ui/react as standard causes an error. One cushion is placed in "./Provider.tsx".
- All Chakra UI components depend on <ChakraProvider>. It only works with Client Component, so if you want to use a UI component you need to wrap it and declare "use client".

### make Provider.tsx

- app/Provider.tsx in

```
"use client";

import { ChakraProvider } from "@chakra-ui/react";

export default function Provider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return <ChakraProvider>{children}</ChakraProvider>;
}
```

### How to shere processing.

- app/common/components/index.tsx in

```
"use client";

export * from "@chakra-ui/react";
```

and using example

```
import { Button(example) } from "./common/components";
```
